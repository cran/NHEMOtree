\title{
Non-hierarchical evolutionary multi-objective tree learner to perform cost-sensitive classification
}
\description{
NHEMO performs cost-sensitive classification by solving the non-hierarchical evolutionary two-objective optimization problem of minimizing misclassification rate and minimizing total costs for classification. NHEMO is based on an EMOA with tree representation and cutoff optimization conducted by the EMOA.

\arguments{
  \item{data}{
A data frame containing in the first column the class for each observation and in the other columns from which variables specified in formula are preferentially to be taken.
}
  \item{CostMatrix}{
A data frame containing the names (first column) and the costs (second column) for each explanatory variable in formula or x. NHEMOtree does not work with missing data in CostMatrix.

Maximal number of generations of the EMOA (default: gens=50).

Preceeding generations for the Online Convergence Detection (OCD, default: ngens=14) (see below for details).
}
  \item{bound}{
Variance limit for the Online convergence detection (default: bound=10^10).

  \item{init_prob}{
Degree of initilization \eqn{\in [0,1]}, i.e. the probability of a node having a subnode.

}
  \item{tournament_size}{
Size of tournament for ps="tournament" (default: tournament_size=4).
}
  \item{crossover}{
Crossover operator, "standard" for one point crossover swapping two randomly chosen subtrees of the parents, "brood" for brood crossover (for details see Tackett (1994)), "poli" for a size-dependent crossover with the crossover point from the so called common region of both parents (for details see Poli and Langdon (1998)).

\details{
With NHEMO a cost-sensitive classification can be performed, i.e. building a tree learner by solving a two-objective optimization problem with regard to minimizing misclassification rate and minimizing total costs for classification (sum of costs for all used variables in the classifier). The non-hierarchical evolutionary multi-objective tree learner performs this multi-objective optimization based on an EMOA with tree representation. It optimizes both objectives simultaneously without any hierarchy and generates Pareto-optimal classifiers being trees to solve the problem. Cutoffs of the tree learners are optimized with the EMOA.

Termination criteria are the maximal amount of generations and the Online Convergence Detection (OCD) proposed by Wagner and Trautmann (2010). Here, OCD uses the dominated hypervolume as quality criterion. If its variance over the last g generations is significantly below a given threshold L according to the one-sided \eqn{\chi^2}-variance test OCD stops the run. We followed the suggestion of Wagner and Trautmann (2010) and considered their parameter settings as default values.

Missing data in the grouping variable or the explanatory variables are excluded from the analysis automatically. 

NHEMO does not work with missing data in CostMatrix. Costs of all explanatory variables set to 1 results in optimizing the amount of explanatory variables in the tree learner as second objective.
